# Z Labs RoundPix 12px

![Title](/img/1.png "Title")

**Z Labs RoundPix 12px** is a 12px Chinese pixel font (actual occupied size of Chinese characters is 11*11) modified and supplemented based on the Japanese font [**x12y12pxMaruMinya**](https://github.com/hicchicc/x12y12pxMaruMinya), adopting a rounded glyph style with Western characters drawn to a monospaced specification.

This project is in the development stage. Currently, it supports Level 1 Chinese characters (and a small number of Level 2 characters) in GB/T 2312, common Western characters, and common punctuation marks, meeting the basic needs for using simplified Chinese characters in simple scenarios.

> [!WARNING]
> 
> **This font is still under development.** There are missing characters, and the details of glyphs are yet to be adjusted.
> 
> If you encounter any issues during use, please promptly provide feedback in the Issues section.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Extensive modifications have been made to the original font to adapt it to the Simplified Chinese environment. For scenarios requiring Japanese usage, it is recommended to use the original font [**x12y12pxMaruMinya**](https://github.com/hicchicc/x12y12pxMaruMinya).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> We are conducting a survey on the usage requirements for pixel fonts.
